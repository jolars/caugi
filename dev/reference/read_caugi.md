# Read caugi Graph from File

Reads a caugi graph from a file in the native caugi JSON format.

## Usage

``` r
read_caugi(path, lazy = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- path:

  Character string specifying the file path.

- lazy:

  Logical; if `FALSE` (default), the graph is built immediately. If
  `TRUE`, graph building is deferred until needed.

## Value

A `caugi` object.

## Details

The function validates the file format and version, ensuring
compatibility with the current version of the caugi package.
