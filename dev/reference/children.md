# Get children of nodes in a `caugi`

Get children of nodes in a graph (nodes with directed edges pointing OUT
from the target nodes). This is equivalent to
`neighbors(cg, nodes, mode = "out")`.

## Usage

``` r
children(cg, nodes = NULL, index = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- cg:

  A `caugi` object.

- nodes:

  A vector of node names, a vector of unquoted node names, or an
  expression combining these with `+` and
  [`c()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html).

- index:

  A vector of node indexes.

## Value

Either a character vector of node names (if a single node is requested)
or a list of character vectors (if multiple nodes are requested).
