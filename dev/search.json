Add simulate_data() enables simulation DAGs using SEMs. Standard linear Gaussian SEMs defaults, importantly custom SEMs available. Add \"AUTO\" parameter class caugi objects. automatically picks graph class order DAG, UG, PDAG, ADMG, AG. Add Ancestral Graphs (AG) support directed, bidirected, undirected edges, plus new queries is_ag() is_mag() m-separation AGs. Add exogenize() function exogenizes variables graph type.

Add native caugi serialization format saving loading graphs. New functions: write_caugi(), read_caugi(), caugi_serialize(), caugi_deserialize(). format versioned JSON schema captures graph structure, class, optional metadata (comments tags). Add plot() method visualizing graphs using various layout algorithms. plot rendered using grid graphics returns caugi_plot object can customized node_style, edge_style, label_style arguments. plot() method accepts layouts strings, functions, pre-computed data.frames. Add caugi_layout() function compute node coordinates graph visualization. Add dedicated layout functions: caugi_layout_sugiyama(), caugi_layout_fruchterman_reingold(), caugi_layout_kamada_kawai(), caugi_layout_bipartite(), caugi_layout_tiered(). function provides API specific algorithm. Add to_dot() write_dot() functions exporting caugi graphs DOT (graphviz) format. resulting object new S7 class, caugi_export, knit_print() method rendering DOT graphs R Markdown Quarto documents. Add GraphML Mermaid import/export support: to_graphml, write_graphml, read_graphml, to_mermaid, write_mermaid, read_mermaid Add plot composition operators creating multi-plot layouts: + | horizontal arrangement, / vertical stacking. Compositions can nested arbitrarily (e.g., (p1 + p2) / p3). Add caugi_options() function setting global defaults plot appearance, including composition spacing default styles nodes, edges, labels, titles. Add caugi_default_options() function query reset package default options. Add new vignette, “Graph Visualization caugi”, demonstrating new plotting capabilities customization options.","code":""},{"path":"https://caugi.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"improvements-1-0-0","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"Improvements","title":"caugi 1.0.0","text":"Add favicons package website.
