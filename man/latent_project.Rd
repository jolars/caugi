\title{Project latent variables from a DAG to an ADMG}
\usage{
latent_project(cg, latents)
}
\arguments{
\item{cg}{A \code{caugi} object of class \code{"DAG"}.}

\item{latents}{Character vector of latent variable names to project out.}
}
\value{
A \code{caugi} object of class \code{"ADMG"} containing only the observed
variables, with directed edges preserved and bidirected edges added where
nodes share latent ancestors.
}
\description{
Projects out latent (unobserved) variables from a DAG to produce an
Acyclic Directed Mixed Graph (ADMG) over the observed variables.
}
\details{
The latent projection is a fundamental operation in causal inference for
converting a DAG with latent variables to an ADMG representing the marginal
independence structure over observed variables only.

The algorithm:
\enumerate{
\item Removes all latent nodes from the graph.
\item For each pair of observed nodes (X, Y) \strong{without an existing directed edge},
adds a bidirected edge X <-> Y if and only if they share a latent ancestor
(i.e., An(X) ∩ An(Y) ∩ Latents is non-empty).
\item Preserves directed edges between observed nodes.
}

Note: Since simple graphs cannot have parallel edges, a bidirected edge is
NOT added between nodes that already have a directed edge. The directed edge
takes precedence.

Note: The resulting ADMG will have nodes re-indexed, preserving the
relative order of observed nodes from the original DAG.

\examples{
# DAG with latent confounder U
dag <- caugi(
  U \%-->\% X,
  U \%-->\% Y,
  X \%-->\% Y,
  class = "DAG"
)

# Project out the latent variable
admg <- latent_project(dag, latents = "U")
# Result: X -> Y, X <-> Y (confounded direct effect)

edges(admg)
