# caugi 0.4.0

* Add support for Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs), which combine directed
  edges representing causal relationships with bidirected edges representing 
  latent confounding.
* Add new functions for querying ADMGs: `is_admg()`, `spouses()`, `districts()`, 
  and `m_separated()` (generalization of d-separation for graphs with bidirected 
  edges).
* Add functions for adjustment set validation in ADMGs: 
  `is_valid_adjustment_admg()` and `all_adjustment_sets_admg()` implementing 
  the Generalized Adjustment Criterion.
* Add `mutate_caugi()` function that allows conversion from one graph type to 
  another.
* Add custom printing method for `caugi` objects.
* Add optional `edges_df` argument to `caugi()` for easier construction from 
  existing data frames containing the columns `from`, `edge`, and `to`.
* Improve error handling across all graph types (DAG, PDAG, UG, ADMG) with more 
  descriptive error messages.
* Update `as_adjacency()` and `as_igraph()` to support bidirected edges.
* Update `as_caugi()` documentation to include "ADMG" as a valid class type for 
  conversion.

# caugi 0.3.2

* Change website to `caugi.org/`.
* Minor modifications to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* Minor `README` rewrite.
