# caugi 1.3.0

## New Features

- Add `enumerate_dags()` to enumerate every DAG in the Markov equivalence
  class of a PDAG, and `count_dags()` to return the MEC size without
  materializing every DAG ([#297](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/297)).
- `plot()` now automatically bends edges around non-incident nodes that they
  would otherwise pass straight through, so edges between collinear nodes (e.g.
  within a tier) and edges crossing unrelated nodes stay visible. This is
  controlled by `edge_style$route` (default `TRUE`); disable it with
  `edge_style = list(route = FALSE)`, or per edge type/edge via the usual
  `edge_style` overrides.
- Add `==` and `!=` methods for `caugi` objects so `cg1 == cg2` returns a single
  logical comparing graph content (class, nodes, edges, `simple`) rather than
  session identity.
- Add first-class `"CPDAG"` graph class support across the constructor
  (`caugi()`), coercion (`as_caugi()`), and class mutation (`mutate_caugi()`).
  Construction validates the full CPDAG invariant (chordal chain components, an
  acyclic component DAG, Meek closure, and strong arrow protection).
  `generate_graph(class = "CPDAG")` now returns a graph with
  `@graph_class = "CPDAG"` instead of `"MPDAG"`, the precise label for the
  essential graph of a Markov equivalence class. Predicates defined on PDAGs and
  MPDAGs (`is_pdag()`, `is_mpdag()`, etc.) continue to accept CPDAGs unchanged.
- Meek-closed PDAGs are now reported with `@graph_class = "MPDAG"` instead of
  `"PDAG"`. This affects the result of `meek_closure()` and
  `generate_graph(class = "CPDAG")`. Predicates and verbs defined on PDAGs
  (`is_pdag()`, `mutate_caugi()`, etc.) continue to accept MPDAGs unchanged.

## Improvements

- `aid()` is now implemented natively in caugi's Rust backend, removing the
  external `gadjid` dependency (and its pinned git revision and vendored
  sources). Results are unchanged. The AID implementation
  (`src/rust/src/graph/aid.rs`) is a derivative of `gadjid` and is licensed
  MPL-2.0; the rest of the crate remains MIT. `aid()` now takes inputs of class
  `"DAG"` or `"CPDAG"` (previously `"DAG"` or `"PDAG"`).
- Licensing of bundled code is now declared for CRAN: a top-level `LICENSE.note`
  documents the MPL-2.0 component (the AID files derived from `gadjid`) and the
  licenses of the vendored Rust crates, and their copyright holders are recorded
  via `cph`/`ctb` roles in `Authors@R`.
- `adjustment_set(type = "backdoor")` now returns an inclusion-minimal backdoor
  adjustment set, computed in linear time as a minimal d-separator in the proper
  backdoor graph, rather than the full set of parents of the exposure.
- The performance vignette is now a true vignette (rather than a pkgdown-only
  article) and is rebuilt manually from a cross-language harness under
  `tools/benchmark/`. The harness compares `caugi` to `igraph`, `bnlearn`,
  `dagitty`, `ggm`, `pcalg`, `pgmpy`, and Tetrad on a `n ∈ {100, 1000, 10000}`
  grid. The d-separation benchmark now uses a minimal d-separator computed via
  `minimal_separator()` (previously used a backdoor adjustment set, which is
  not in general a d-separating set).

## Bug Fixes

- Fix `hd()` returning results that depended on the order in which nodes were
  declared. The Hamming distance now aligns nodes by name before comparing, so
  logically identical graphs always give the same distance ([#323](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/323)).
- Fix `dag_from_pdag()` failing with `` `from`, `edge`, `to` must be equal
  length. `` when a sink had multiple undirected neighbors ([#298](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/298)).
- Fixed a bug causing a partially undirected (`--o`) edges to
  be plotted as undirected edges.
- Fix `adjustment_set(type = "backdoor")` returning an invalid (often empty)
  set when a parent of the exposure lies on a backdoor path but is not an
  ancestor of the outcome ([#308](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/308)). The result is now always a valid backdoor
  adjustment set.
- Fixed `is_mag()` returning incorrect results for some ancestral graphs
  ([#309](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/309)).
  Adjacency was tested by binary-searching the concatenation of separately
  sorted neighbor buckets, which is not globally sorted, so some adjacent
  pairs were missed.
- Stripped non-build files (`tests/`, `examples/`, trybuild fixtures) from the
  vendored Rust dependencies so no vendored path exceeds 100 characters. This
  silences pak's "very long paths" warning and avoids installation failures on
  Windows without long-path support ([#319](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/319)).
- Fixed `to_dot()` and `to_mermaid()` (and `write_dot()`/`write_mermaid()`)
  silently converting partial `--o` and `o-o` edges into plain directed edges,
  dropping the circle endpoints ([#307](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/307)).

## Deprecations

- The first argument of `dag_from_pdag()` is now named `cg`, matching the
  convention used by the rest of the package. The previous name `PDAG`
  continues to work as an alias but emits a deprecation warning.

# caugi 1.2.0

## New Features

- Add `caugi_layout_circle()` and a `"circle"` method for `caugi_layout()` that
  places nodes evenly along the perimeter of a circle ([#108](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/108)).
- Add `list_caugi_edges()` function to list all available edge types.
- Add first-class `"MPDAG"` graph class support across constructor, class
  mutation, and class resolution. `class = "AUTO"` now resolves Meek-closed
  PDAGs to `"MPDAG"`.

## Improvements

- Improved performance of all queries. Speedups are more significant on larger
  graphs, but even on small graphs, queries are roughly 5x faster.
- `exogenize()` is now implemented in Rust for DAGs, which reduces overhead on larger graphs.
- `normalize_latent_structure()` is now implemented in Rust for DAGs for faster latent normalization workflows.
- `minimal_d_separator()` is renamed to `minimal_separator()` and now supports
  ADMG and AG inputs (previously DAG-only), returning a minimal m-separator.
  Implemented via the unified linear-time algorithm of van der Zander &
  Liśkiewicz (UAI 2020). The old name `minimal_d_separator()` remains as a
  deprecated alias.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix `m_separated()` on ADMGs: moralization now marries every pair in
  `pa(v) ∪ sp(v)`, not just `pa(v)`. The old code missed moral edges from
  bidirected co-parents and gave false positives (e.g. claimed `Z ⊥ Y | X` for
  `Z -> X -> Y`, `X <-> Y`).
- Fix `is_valid_adjustment_admg()` and `all_adjustment_sets_admg()` to verify
  the GAC's m-separation condition in the proper backdoor graph rather than
  via a per-neighbour decomposition. The old check trivially accepted neighbours
  of `X` that were themselves in `Z`, so it falsely classified `{C}` as a valid
  adjustment set in the M-bias ADMG `C -> X, C <-> X, C -> Y, C <-> Y, X -> Y`
  ([#277](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/277)).

# caugi 1.1.0

## New Features

- Add `normalize_latent_structure()`, which normalizes the latent structure of a
  DAG while preserving the marginal model over observed variables.
- Add `minimal_d_separator()`, which computes a minimal d-separator between
  sets of nodes in a DAG, with support for mandatory inclusions and restrictions.
- Add `posteriors()` query function, which is the dual of `anteriors()`. It
  returns all nodes reachable by following paths where every edge is either
  undirected or directed away from the source node. For DAGs, `posteriors()`
  equals `descendants()`. For PDAGs and AGs, it includes both descendants and
  nodes reachable via undirected edges.
- You can now specify whether to use an open or closed graph definition for the
  queries `ancestors()`, `anteriors()`, `descendants()`, and `posteriors()`.
  This can be set globally with `caugi_options()` or locally with the
  `open = TRUE/FALSE` argument. The default remains `open = TRUE`.
- Add `is_mpdag()` query to check whether a PDAG is closed under Meek's
  orientation rules (R1-R4), and `meek_closure()` to orient all implied edges
  until Meek closure.

## Improvements

- `caugi_options()` now supports nested key drilling: multiple unnamed arguments
  traverse nested options (e.g., `caugi_options("plot", "tier_style", "fill")`).
- Rust remains the single source of truth for graph state. Graph properties
  (`simple`, `graph_class`, `nodes`, `edges`) are sourced from the `session`.
  - A session is always created, including empty graphs (n = 0), which simplifies
    property access.
  - Deprecated compatibility properties `@.state`, `@name_index_map`, `@built`,
    and `@ptr` now warn on access and return `NULL`.
  - Deprecated compatibility constructor arguments `build` and `state` in
    `caugi()` now warn and are ignored.
- The `inplace` parameter in verb functions (`add_edges()`, `remove_edges()`,
  `set_edges()`, `add_nodes()`, `remove_nodes()`). All graph modifications now use
  copy-on-write semantics for consistency with R conventions. The parameter is
  deprecated and ignored with a warning.
- Added `all.equal` and `compare_proxy` methods for caugi objects to support
  graph-content comparison in tests.
- Add `asp` parameter to `plot()` for controlling the aspect ratio. When `asp = 1`,
  the plot respects equal units on both axes, preserving the layout
  coordinates. Works like base R's `asp` parameter (y/x aspect ratio) ([#195](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/195)).
- Add `pdag_to_dag()` function that generates a random DAG consistent with a
  given CPDAG/PDAG structure if possible ([#201](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/201)).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug causing `plot()` to use incorrect layout if node names were not
  in the same order as in the graph object ([#198](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi/issues/198)).
- Fixed `set_edges()` so that it correctly replaces symmetric edges in
  simple graphs.

## Deprecations

- The parameter `all` in `districts()` has been deprecated. Use `districts()`
  without arguments to get all districts.

# caugi 1.0.0

## New Features

- Add support for Ancestral Graphs (AGs), which combine directed (`-->`),
  bidirected (`<->`), and undirected (`---`) edges while satisfying ancestral
  graph constraints. New functions: `is_ag()`, `is_mag()`.
- Add `mode` argument to `neighbors()`/`neighbours()` to filter neighbors by edge
  direction or type (`"all"`, `"in"`, `"out"`, `"undirected"`, `"bidirected"`,
  `"partial"`). This is a structural query, and not a semantic query!
- `neighbors()` now supports `class = "UNKNOWN"` graphs, including `mode`-based
  filtering.
- Add `simulate_data()` that enables simulation from DAGs using SEMs. Standard
  linear Gaussian SEMs are defaults, but more importantly custom SEMs are
  available.
- Add `"AUTO"` parameter for `class` in `caugi` objects. This automatically
  picks the graph class in order `DAG`, `UG`, `PDAG`, `ADMG`, `AG`.
- Add Ancestral Graphs (AG) with support for directed, bidirected, and
  undirected edges, plus new queries `is_ag()` and `is_mag()` and m-separation
  for AGs.
- Add `exogenize()` function that exogenizes variables for any graph type.
  Current implementation is written in R, but it is so simple that it might be
  preferable over a Rust implementation. This might be changed later.
- Add `latent_project()` function that does latent projection from DAGs to
  ADMGs.
- Add native caugi serialization format for saving and loading graphs. New
  functions: `write_caugi()`, `read_caugi()`, `caugi_serialize()`, and
  `caugi_deserialize()`. The format is a versioned JSON schema that captures
  graph structure, class, and optional metadata (comments and tags).
- Add `plot()` method for visualizing graphs using various layout algorithms.
  The plot is rendered using grid graphics and returns a `caugi_plot` object
  that can be customized with `node_style`, `edge_style`, and `label_style`
  arguments. The `plot()` method accepts layouts as strings, functions, or
  pre-computed data.frames.
- Add `caugi_layout()` function to compute node coordinates for graph
  visualization.
- Add dedicated layout functions: `caugi_layout_sugiyama()`,
  `caugi_layout_fruchterman_reingold()`, `caugi_layout_kamada_kawai()`,
  `caugi_layout_bipartite()`, and `caugi_layout_tiered()`. Each function
  provides an API for its specific algorithm.
- Add `to_dot()` and `write_dot()` functions for exporting caugi graphs to DOT
  (graphviz) format. The resulting object is a new S7 class, `caugi_export`,
  which has a `knit_print()` method for rendering DOT graphs in R Markdown and
  Quarto documents.
- Add GraphML and Mermaid import/export support: `to_graphml`, `write_graphml`,
  `read_graphml`, `to_mermaid`, `write_mermaid`, and `read_mermaid`
- Add plot composition operators for creating multi-plot layouts: `+` and `|`
  for horizontal arrangement, `/` for vertical stacking. Compositions can be
  nested arbitrarily (e.g., `(p1 + p2) / p3`).
- Add `caugi_options()` function for setting global defaults for plot
  appearance, including composition spacing and default styles for nodes,
  edges, labels, and titles.
- Add `caugi_default_options()` function to query or reset to package default options.
- Add a new vignette, "Graph Visualization with caugi", demonstrating the new
  plotting capabilities and customization options.

## Improvements

- Add favicons for the package website.
- Standardize `is_caugi()` validation calls internally.
- Adopt [air](https://github.com/posit-dev/air) as the R code formatter for the package.
- `caugi_layout_tiered()` now returns a `tier` column and `orientation` attribute in the layout data.frame, allowing `plot()` to automatically use tier information without requiring the `tiers` argument to be passed again.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix typo in error messages and documentation examples.
- Remove unused `index_name_map` parameter from internal `.cg_state()` function.
- Fix interpretation of directed edge endpoint positions in the Rust backend,
  improving correctness of direction-dependent algorithms/metrics (e.g.
  topological sorting and structural Hamming distance computations).
- Fix bug in `is_cpdag` function that returns `TRUE` on non-complete PDAGs.
- Fix bug in `shd` returning positive values for equivalent graphs given in shuffled order.

# caugi 0.4.0

- Add support for Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs), which combine directed
  edges representing causal relationships with bidirected edges representing
  latent confounding.
- Add new functions for querying ADMGs: `is_admg()`, `spouses()`, `districts()`,
  and `m_separated()` (generalization of d-separation for graphs with bidirected
  edges).
- Add functions for adjustment set validation in ADMGs:
  `is_valid_adjustment_admg()` and `all_adjustment_sets_admg()` implementing
  the Generalized Adjustment Criterion.

  another.
- Add custom printing method for `caugi` objects.
