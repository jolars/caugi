# caugi 0.5.0
## New Features

* Add `mode` argument to `neighbors()`/`neighbours()` to filter neighbors by edge
  direction or type (`"all"`, `"in"`, `"out"`, `"undirected"`, `"bidirected"`,
  `"partial"`). This is a structural query, and not a  semantic query!
* `neighbors()` now supports `class = "UNKNOWN"` graphs, including `mode`-based
  filtering.
* Add `simulate_data()` that enables simulation from DAGs using SEMs. Standard linear Gaussian SEMs are defaults, but more importantly custom SEMs are available. 
* Add `"AUTO"` parameter for `class` in `caugi` objects. This automatically picks the graph class in order `DAG`, `UG`, `PDAG`, `ADMG`. 
* Add `exogenize()` function that exogenizes variables for any graph type. Current implementation is written in R, but it is so simple that it might be preferable over a Rust implementation. This might be changed later. 
* Add `latent_project()` function that does latent projection from DAGs to ADMGs. 
* Add native caugi serialization format for saving and loading graphs. New functions: `write_caugi()`, `read_caugi()`, `caugi_serialize()`, and `caugi_deserialize()`. The format is a versioned JSON schema that captures graph structure, class, and optional metadata (comments and tags).
* Add `plot()` method for visualizing graphs using the Sugiyama algorithm for DAGs and a force-directed algorithm for other graphs. The plot is rendered using grid graphics and returns a `caugi_plot` object that can be customized with `node_style`, `edge_style`, and `label_style` arguments. The `plot()` method accepts layouts as strings, functions, or pre-computed data.frames.
* Add `caugi_layout()` function to compute node coordinates for graph visualization using the Sugiyama layout algorithm.
* Add dedicated layout functions: `caugi_layout_sugiyama()`, `caugi_layout_fruchterman_reingold()`, `caugi_layout_kamada_kawai()`, and `caugi_layout_bipartite()`. Each function provides a focused API for its specific algorithm.
* Add bipartite graph layout support with `caugi_layout_bipartite()`, which places nodes in two parallel lines (rows or columns) based on a user-provided partition.
* Add `to_dot()` and `write_dot()` functions for exporting caugi graphs to DOT
  (graphviz) format. The resulting object is a new S7 class, `caugi_export`,
  which has a `knit_print()` method for rendering DOT graphs in R Markdown and
  Quarto documents.
* Add GraphML and Mermaid import/export support: `to_graphml`, `write_graphml`, `read_graphml`, `to_mermaid`, `write_mermaid`, and `read_mermaid` 
* Add plot composition operators for creating multi-plot layouts: `+` and `|` for horizontal arrangement, `/` for vertical stacking. Compositions can be nested arbitrarily (e.g., `(p1 + p2) / p3`).
* Add `caugi_options()` function for setting global defaults for plot appearance, including composition spacing and default styles for nodes, edges, labels, and titles.
* Add `caugi_default_options()` function to query or reset to package default options.
* Add a new vignette, "Graph Visualization with caugi", demonstrating the new
  plotting capabilities and customization options.

## Improvements

* Add favicons for the package website.
* Standardize `is_caugi()` validation calls internally. 
* Adopt [air](https://github.com/posit-dev/air) as the R code formatter for the package.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix typo in error messages and documentation examples.
* Remove unused `index_name_map` parameter from internal `.cg_state()` function.
* Fix interpretation of directed edge endpoint positions in the Rust backend,
  improving correctness of direction-dependent algorithms/metrics (e.g.
  topological sorting and structural Hamming distance computations).

# caugi 0.4.0

* Add support for Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs), which combine directed
  edges representing causal relationships with bidirected edges representing 
  latent confounding.
* Add new functions for querying ADMGs: `is_admg()`, `spouses()`, `districts()`, 
  and `m_separated()` (generalization of d-separation for graphs with bidirected 
  edges).
* Add functions for adjustment set validation in ADMGs: 
  `is_valid_adjustment_admg()` and `all_adjustment_sets_admg()` implementing 
  the Generalized Adjustment Criterion.
* Add `mutate_caugi()` function that allows conversion from one graph type to 
  another.
* Add custom printing method for `caugi` objects.
* Add optional `edges_df` argument to `caugi()` for easier construction from 
  existing data frames containing the columns `from`, `edge`, and `to`.
* Improve error handling across all graph types (DAG, PDAG, UG, ADMG) with more 
  descriptive error messages.
* Update `as_adjacency()` and `as_igraph()` to support bidirected edges.
* Update `as_caugi()` documentation to include "ADMG" as a valid class type for 
  conversion.
